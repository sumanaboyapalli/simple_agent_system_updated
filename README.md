# simple_agent_system_updated
creating a simple client-server Python program using sockets. The client will send a "ping" message, and the server, whether on the same network or a different network, will reply with a "pong" message. If the devices are on different networks, you would need to know the external IP address of the network where the server is located
Run the pong.py on the server device which will wait for a connection and respond with "pong" when "ping" is received.
Run the ping.py on the client device, enter the IP of the server device when prompted, and it will send a "ping" message to the server and print the received "pong" message.
